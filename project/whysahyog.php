					<h2>Why Sahyog?</h2>
					<p>
		 			Sahyog is a platform where the users can easily donate and support orphanages. Also, orphanages would be able to reach to the people and raise funds to operate. This is not only the platform but also a voice of the orphans and other needy people who are literally starving for help since a long time.
		 			</p>
		 			<p>
		 			This website is internationally approved, therefore, people from any countries can reach out the helping hands in the form of charity/donation. Only because of people’s help, orphans will be able to get the shelter to live, food to have and clothes to wear. They will get the better chance to change their lifestyle into the sustainable lifestyle.  
		 			</p>
		 			<p>
		 			From this platform, we are trying to bring smile on every orphan’s face and spread tons of happiness in their life. We should always remember ‘our one help will saves someone’s life’.
